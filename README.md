# CardioR

CardioR is an R-based project designed to analyze cardiovascular data. This repository includes scripts and datasets to facilitate the exploration and visualization of heart-related metrics.

## Repository Contents

- **Script**: `datascience.R` – The primary R script for data analysis.
- **Dataset**: `dataset_1.csv` – Contains the cardiovascular data used in the analysis.
- **R History**: `.Rhistory` – Records of the R commands executed during the analysis.

## Getting Started

To utilize this project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ruturajpatil-5522/CardioR.git
   cd CardioR
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Ensure [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is installed on your system.
   - Install necessary R packages by running the following commands in your R console:
     ```R
     install.packages("ggplot2")
     install.packages("dplyr")
     # Add any other required packages here
     ```

3. **Run the Analysis**:
   - Open `datascience.R` in your preferred R environment (e.g., RStudio).
   - Execute the script to perform data analysis and generate visualizations based on `dataset_1.csv`.

## Usage

The `datascience.R` script is structured to:

- Load and preprocess the data from `dataset_1.csv`.
- Perform statistical analyses pertinent to cardiovascular metrics.
- Generate visualizations to aid in data interpretation.

Users are encouraged to modify the script to suit their specific data and analysis requirements.
